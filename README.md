My first experience to create  own online shop, my crafted bicycle from nothing . Now I can live, without bugged opencart and without stoled code from "stackOverflow". Feeling happiness =)


1. First commit - I don't already finished my project, but I need a stable backup.

2. Second commit - Writed category filter for render from JSON. Fixed carouselle, Changed empty slides to products from JSON with links to detailes.
